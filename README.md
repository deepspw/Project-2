# Project 2 : Tournament Results 

## Description

This project was created for udacity. Using the given project template I
created a Python module for keeping track of tournament matches using a 
PostgreSQL database.

## Requirements

	- Python
	- psycopg2
	- Machine running PostgreSQL
	
## How to use

Connect to your PostgreSQL DB and run the command \i tournament.sql
to execute the schema. Use the module by importing it into your python scripts. 
tournament_test.py gives a general test of the functions in the module
which is part of the assessment.
